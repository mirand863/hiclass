=====================
Parallel Training
=====================

Larger datasets require more time for training.
While by default the models in HiClass are trained using a single core,
it is possible to train each local classifier in parallel by leveraging the library Ray [1]_.
In this example, we demonstrate how to train a hierarchical classifier in parallel,
using all the cores available on a mock dataset from Kaggle [2]_.

A "Hello World" example
=======================

It is time to introduce the most basic elements of HiClass. We have split a small example into sections to discuss each of the concepts with code.

You can copy the example as one chunk of code from the last page of this section.

.. note::

    We do not use real data in this first example, but illustrate the concepts within a single ``.py`` file.

Install HiClass
===============

To install HiClass from the Python Package Index (PyPI) simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install hiclass

.. note::

    It is also possible to install HiClass using :literal:`conda`, as follows, but we recommend using :literal:`pip` at this point to eliminate any potential dependency issues, as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge hiclass --yes

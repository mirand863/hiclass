Learn how to use HiClass
========================

In the next few chapters, you will learn how to `install HiClass <TODO>`_ and set up your own production-ready hierarchical pipelines.

Once you are set up, we suggest working through our examples, including:

- A typical "Hello World" example, for an `entry-level description of the main concepts <TODO>`_.
- A more detailed `tutorial <TODO>`_ to give you hands-on experience.

We also recommend the :ref:`API reference documentation` for additional information.

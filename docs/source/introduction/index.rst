What is HiClass?
================

HiClass is an open-source Python library for hierarchical classification compatible with scikit-learn.
It mirrors the popular API from scikit-learn to train and predict with the most common design patterns for local hierarchical classification.
Implemented models include the local classifiers per node, per parent node and per level.
HiClass is released under the simplified `BSD 3-Clause license <https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>`_.

For the source code, please take a look at the `repository on Github <https://github.com/mirand863/hiclass>`_.

Learn how to use HiClass
========================

In the next few chapters, you will learn how to `install HiClass <TODO>`_ and set up your own production-ready hierarchical pipelines.

Once you are set up, we suggest working through our examples, including:

- A typical "Hello World" example, for an `entry-level description of the main concepts <TODO>`_.
- A more detailed `tutorial <TODO>`_ to give you hands-on experience.

We also recommend the `API reference documentation <TODO>`_ for additional information.

Assumptions
===========

We have designed the documentation and the `tutorial <TODO>`_ for anyone new to HiClass. The more knowledge of Python you have, the easier you will find the learning curve.

.. note::

   There are a number of excellent online resources for learning Python, but you should choose those that reference Python 3, as HiClass is built for Python 3.7+. There are many curated lists of online resources, such as the `official Python programming language website <https://www.python.org/>`_ and `this list of free programming books and tutorials <https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/books/free-programming-books-langs.md#python>`_.

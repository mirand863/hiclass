Assumptions
===========

We have designed the documentation and the `tutorial <TODO>`_ for anyone new to HiClass. The more knowledge of Python you have, the easier you will find the learning curve.

.. note::

   There are a number of excellent online resources for learning Python, but you should choose those that reference Python 3, as HiClass is built for Python 3.7+. There are many curated lists of online resources, such as the `official Python programming language website <https://www.python.org/>`_ and `this list of free programming books and tutorials <https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/books/free-programming-books-langs.md#python>`_.
